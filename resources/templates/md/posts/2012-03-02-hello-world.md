I keep myself fully amused with the visual arts. For my not-so-updated website go to Andrea Carlson. For last effort with sequential art see [Fritz Bogott](http://fritzbogott.com/2011/11/17/boy-meets-girl-at-a-cockfight/).

To complete my various shelved projects, which often have no deadlines, I’ve created this blog as a semi-private journal of progress. I’ll post images once a week, until I have to upgrade my storage capacity. If you’ve stumbled upon this blog, I hope you enjoy it.
